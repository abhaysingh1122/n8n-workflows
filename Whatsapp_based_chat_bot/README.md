WhatsApp-Based Chatbot
This repository contains an n8n workflow for a simple WhatsApp chatbot. It uses the WhatsApp Business Cloud API to receive messages and an AI Agent powered by OpenAI to generate responses.

Features
Automated Responses: Automatically replies to incoming WhatsApp messages.

AI-Powered: Uses the OpenAI gpt-4o-mini model for natural language understanding and response generation.

Contextual Memory: Maintains a conversation history for each user to provide more relevant and coherent replies.

Prerequisites
To use this workflow, you will need:

An active n8n instance (either self-hosted or cloud).

A WhatsApp Business Account with access to the WhatsApp Business Cloud API.

An OpenAI API Key.

Setup Instructions
Import the n8n Workflow:

Open your n8n instance and create a new workflow.

Click on the "Import from File" option and upload the JSON file from this repository.

Configure Credentials:

WhatsApp Trigger: Set up your WhatsApp Business Cloud API credentials and configure the webhook URL in your Meta for Developers dashboard.

OpenAI Chat Model: Provide your OpenAI API Key by creating a new credential.

WhatsApp Business Cloud: Enter your Phone Number ID and create a new credential for your WhatsApp Business Cloud access token.

Activate the Workflow: After configuring all the nodes and credentials, save the workflow and activate it to start listening for messages.

How it Works
A message from a user triggers the WhatsApp Trigger node.

The message content and user's phone number are passed to the AI Agent node.

The AI Agent uses the OpenAI Chat Model to process the message and generate a response.

The Simple Memory node maintains the conversation context for a better user experience.

Finally, the WhatsApp Business Cloud node sends the AI-generated response back to the user.
