# n8n Workflows
This repository contains a collection of various n8n workflows designed to automate and streamline different processes. Each workflow is a self-contained solution, handling everything from data ingestion and analysis to general automation tasks. The goal is to provide a central hub for reusable and customizable workflows.

## Workflows
This repository contains the following n8n workflows:

- **🌐Vector database creator and analyser:**
